Notes for resident course.

Be sure to add questions

Transcatheter study

Important  points for discussion:

-- Introductions

-- Begin with someone presenting the study

-- Overall study vs subgroups

-- Difference between abstract and discussion:  will the subsequent studies be ethical?  Equipoise

-- ITT vs per protocol, and why

-- Standard p-values are not as useful in NI studies

-- Differences between risk ratio and hazard ratio.  Not an important distinction in this trial.

-- Add the following to the RMD file


-- Important questions when reading paper

   -- What was primary endpoint?  Well chosen, clinically relevant?
   
   -- Was the design adequately powered for the clinically relevant endpoint
   
   -- Did the randomization produce balance?
   
   -- Did the analysis reflect the design?
   
   -- Was the rate in the control group close to the design spec.  A bit lower in this study, 19% vs 30%.  Note that these are pure percentages, not KM estimates, but ok with complete follow-up to two years
   
   -- What does the primary analysis show?
   
      -- Should it be ITT, or PP
	  
	  -- Focus on confidence intervals, not only on p-values
	  
   -- Are the trial results consistent? Across subgroups, across secondary endpoints?
   
      -- Low power in subgroups.
	  
  -- Do the conclusions in the  discussion match those in the abstract
	  



Abstract: 

2032 patients randomized

Primary endpoint: death from any cause or disabling stroke at 2 years.

Randomization between TAVR and conventional surgery

-- Two strata: transfemoral and transthoracic access

-- Overall design: risk ratio < 1.20, TAVR/Surgery.  Based on estimates at 2 years of KM, using standard errors


Abstract discusses the transfemoral access cohort

-- Should we have allowed this?  It was pre-specified in SAP.

-- What does it do to the NI conclusion?

-- First time in high risk patients

-- Get figure S2 in supplemental figures.  It has the design
