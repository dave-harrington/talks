**Robert Gentleman**

Robert Gentleman Symposium in honor of his 60th birthday

27 June 2019

*Thank you*

Thanks so much to the organizers for a wonderful program, and for inviting me to participate.  It is an honor...

*Bio at dfci*

- From 1998 - 2004, RG was associate professor at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.  Earlier in the 1990's he was a visiting faculty member while on leave from Auckland.

- His Permanent appointment at DFCI was in Department of Biostatistics, where I was chair during much of his time. 
 
- Robert was (literally) a pivotal member of the department during that time.  

- During his time the name was changed to Biostatistics and Computational Biology, largely because of his work.  Under Rafa's leadership has since been changed to the Department of Data Sciences.

*Background*

When Robert arrived, the department essentially a clinical trials shop, relying on locally written software for randomization and registration and analysis, written during the previous 20 years. 

We were  tentatively moving into the brave new world of SAS the cutting edge of modern statistical computing.  

We were a highly regarded, productive, backwater of computational statistics.  We did not know that, and we had lots of company.

Todd Golub had published his initial work in molecular classification of ALL in 1999, but that work had been done in collaboration with the Broad.

*What happened during Robert's time?*

- We hired Cheng Li, now at Peking University, who had written dChip, Xiaole Liu.  I believe Robert was a key member of the search committee that hired both individuals.   
   
- We were all impressed by dChip, which initially was a tour de force in Excel and (probably) fortran.    

- Robert recognized that Cheng's approach would not scale, and would struggle with new assays on the  horizon.  More on that later.    

- Robert put us at the early intersection between clinical research and molecular biology, getting grants or subcontracts in 

	- Risk Classification of Adult ALL Based on Gene Signature (ECOG)  

	- Graphs and Networks: A Statistical Software Framework    

	- Center for Computational Study of Biological Systems      

	- Fundamental work on Breast and GI SPORE grants   

	- Began training of graduate students, post  docs, and new faculty in computational biology, Denise is one of the several great success stories.   
	
	- He coaxed the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group into the Open Source world by rewriting its clinical trials registration and randomization software.   Foundation for RandPack package.  

	- As everyone here knows, the code in that project is less important than the structured, modular design built around a careful specification of the goals of randomization.

*BioConductor*

There are many contributions that Robert made to the department and the world around it, left the biggest for last.

- As everyone here knows,  Robert launched Bioconductor in 2001.   but I can add a personal note about Bioconductor.

- In 2001, the three most visible competing pieces of software for analysing molecular were dChip, the software pipeline at the Broad, and Rosetta.  

- Robert reminded us that dChip would not scale, the Broad might be well-thought out but was available to only Broad investigators, and Rosetta was expensive, commercial, proprietary software.

- Magically, he not only convinced me of the weaknesses in current software, he convinced the lead scientist  in computational biology at dfci, Stan Korsmeyer, that this was a problem worth solving.  

- In perhaps the most remarkable episodes I was privileged to participate,  Stan, Robert and I met informally in one of our small conference rooms.  Robert explained the problem.  Stan asked him what he needed.  Leading edge hardware, two full time programmers and support for his work.  
- Ok, said Stan, they shook hands, and Bioconductor was born.  The only thing Robert got wrong was the name!

*Some personal recollections:*

When you have an admin job, it simply does not pay to look back at decisions and  say we got that one right or I wish I could have that one back, but everybody does it

Bioconductor was the number one thing we got right.  The one I wish I could have back was not fighting harder with hsph and Robert to prevent him from moving to the Hutch.

Robert's work is not just a memory for me.   One of the R progeny, Hadley Wickham's R Studio transformed the way I taught Harvard College freshman and sophomore pre-meds. 
 
- Statistically naive students are able to examine important issues in data from both clinical studies and genomics in the first two weeks of class, banishing those silly made up examples we have used for decades to introduce the science of data.

- R Studio adds a very useful interface, but that is not the most valuable piece of the environment.

- It is the brevity of R, its concise and exact syntax that fosters thinking.  During the last year of my active teaching, I spent considerable time teaching statistics majors to write.  

- Their writing skills were less important than the way in which writing served as a vehicle for sharpening thinking.

- R does that when thinking about data.  Its uncluttered direct syntax for thinking about not only how to do an analysis, but the point of doing it at all.

**Thanks, again**

So thank you, Robert.  

- For R, of course, 

- but also for what you did for DFCI, 

- for providing the foundation for both research computing and the teaching of statistics, 

- but perhaps most of all, for being so gracious in the transition from DFCI to the Hutch.
